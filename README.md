# Personal React Portfolio

## Description
This project was made to learn how to use react to create a dynamically updating webpage with a much easier development process than typical development. This project can also be updated as a personal portfolio in the future to be ready for viewing by potential employers.

## Usage
Navigate to the portfolio link and use the navbar tabs to explore the portfolio website. Hover the project images to reveal a link to the live app or demo, as well as a link to the github repo. Fill in the forms in the contact section to send an email to the portfolio owner (future addition). Finally, click the icons on the footer to be brought to the corresponding links belonging to the portfolio creator.
